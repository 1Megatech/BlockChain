# Introduction
The purpose of blockchain is to store transactions in a secure and reliable way. Transactions are nothing but a combination of inputs and outputs.
Inputs of a transaction is the outputs of previous transactions. Coins are stored in the outputs.
## Note:
- Some outputs are not linked to inputs
- inputs can be outputs from multiple transactions

Transactions lock values with the help of scripting language and it can be unlocked by the owner.
Bitcoin uses a language called "sacript" for locking and unlocking outputs. Outputs are indivisible. We need to spend the output as a whole, if requires is less than output value then we get a cahange in return.

In bitcoin environment "outputs" come before inputs. This can be achieved with the help of "coin based transaction".
Coin based transaction is a special transaction which doesn't require previous output. It creats output(coins) out of nowhere.

Every block must have atleast one transaction.
